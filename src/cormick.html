            <h1 class="site__title">Case Studies in the Intersection of Christianity and Conservative Politics</h1>
            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Overview</h4>
            <p class="site__description">This section presents case studies that illustrate the intersection of Christianity and conservative politics in the United States, showcasing how religious beliefs and political strategies intertwine to shape voter behavior and policy decisions.</p>
            
            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Case Study 1: The Rise of the Moral Majority</h4>
            <p class="site__description">The Moral Majority, founded by Jerry Falwell in 1979, was a prominent political organization that mobilized conservative Christians. It played a crucial role in the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, emphasizing issues such as opposition to abortion, the promotion of traditional family values, and a strong stance against communism. This movement showcased the power of organized religious groups in shaping national politics.

            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Case Study 2: Evangelical Support for Donald Trump</h4>
            <p class="site__description">Despite his controversial behavior and past, Donald Trump garnered substantial support from evangelical Christians during the 2016 and 2020 elections. His administration's policies on religious freedom, anti-abortion stances, and the appointment of conservative judges resonated with this demographic, illustrating the alignment of political strategies with religious values.

            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Case Study 3: The Influence of Religious Media</h4>
            <p class="site__description">Religious media outlets, such as Christian radio stations and television networks, have significantly influenced political opinions among their audiences. These platforms often promote conservative values and endorse political candidates who align with their views, demonstrating the role of media in shaping the political landscape.

            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Case Study 4: Opposition to Same-Sex Marriage</h4>
            <p class="site__description">The fight against same-sex marriage has been a rallying point for conservative Christians. This case study explores how religious beliefs were mobilized to influence political campaigns, legislative efforts, and public opinion, culminating in the significant political mobilization seen in states like California with Proposition 8.

            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Case Study 5: The Intersection of Christianity and Anti-Immigration Policies</h4>
            <p class="site__description">While Christianity traditionally emphasizes compassion and support for the marginalized, some conservative Christian groups have supported stringent anti-immigration policies. This paradox highlights the complex interplay between religious values and political agendas.
