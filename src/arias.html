            <h1 class="site__title">Christianity and the Modern Conservative Movement</h1>
            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Overview</h4>
            <p class="site__description">This section explores the intricate relationship between Christianity and the modern conservative movement in the United States. Religious extremists, regardless of which religion, are consistently swayed to vote red due to their socially conservative values and the right's performative religious rhetoric.</p>
            
            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Influence of Socially Conservative Values on Political Alignment</h4>
            <p class="site__description">Socially conservative values significantly influence political alignment. Regular church attendance and belief in biblical literalism are linked to Republican voting, especially among white evangelicals. For instance, black evangelicals tend to vote Democratic, influenced by church messages on economic and civil rights, while white evangelicals vote Republican due to different church teachings.

            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">The Role of Performative Religious Rhetoric in Conservative Campaigns</h4>
            <p class="site__description">Conservative campaigns often use performative religious rhetoric to appeal to core constituents. Political messages vary in extremity based on the audience, with more extreme messages targeting core supporters. Trump actively courts Christian nationalist voters, making explicit appeals to the role of Christianity they support.

            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Media Influence and the Manipulation of Religious Beliefs</h4>
            <p class="site__description">Media plays a significant role in shaping religious and political ideologies. Fear of LGBTQ+ people, often used as a political wedge issue, is not a biblical value but a manipulation of religious beliefs. Christian nationalism is seen as a political ploy by wealthy interests to divide people. Media narratives often stoke fears and divisions within religious communities to drive political alignment.

            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Impact of Religious Extremism on Modern Republican Policies</h4>
            <p class="site__description">Religious extremism significantly impacts modern Republican policies, increasingly reflecting socially conservative values. White evangelical Christians are more likely to support radical measures, including violence, to "save the country," reflecting extreme political views. This radicalism poses a threat to democratic values and public life.

            <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Statistical Patterns</h4>
            <p class="site__description">The correlation between regular church attendance and Republican voting highlights the significant influence of religious practice on political behavior. The increasing alignment of religious extremists with the Republican Party demonstrates the success of targeted political strategies and performative rhetoric in mobilizing this demographic.
